MustacheExamples
================

Watch this space for examples of mustache using JavaScript

The mustache usage document is crystal clear but it lacks one small thing... how the user is supposed to implement the code? There was no complete guide on how to create HTML snippets, where to put the templates, how to reference them, etc., I will try to cover the gaps which was found when I learned mustache.

I will also try and contribute some useful utilities which would be leveraging mustache, after all nothing would be fruitful unless we create somthing meaningful.

I will also explain each and every example which i create here as far as I could in ny personal blog (http://prabhakarana.com)

Happy Coding!!!
